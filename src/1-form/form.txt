<form></form> - is traditional HTML part. Which send our collected information from our inputs, 
which are wrapped inside the Form. And sends collected data from Browser to Server.

If we don't have JavaScript in our code, then we use <form></form>.
But when we are working with JavaScript, we absolutely, don't need <form></form>.

FORM is only mechanism, without JavaScript help, to send data to the server. 
With collecting data it has nothing todo. INPUTS are responsible for collecting data.

With JavaScript, INPUTS are collecting data, and JavaScript sends that data.
